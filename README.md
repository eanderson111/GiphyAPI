# GiphyAPI

A fun, simple tool to find gifs of your favorite 80s artists. Simply click on one of the buttons displayed or use the form field to enter an artist of your choice to get 10 of their gifs. 

Most importantly, have fun!

In this assignment, I used GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.
